# Legacy Simpletest module for Jelix

This is a module for [the framework Jelix](http://jelix.org), allowing to write
tests with Simpletest, inside a Jelix application.

Simpletests was the test framework used in Jelix from Jelix 1.0 to Jelix 1.3.
And it was removed completely in Jelix 1.7. So it is not anymore the official test
framework of Jelix. We encourage to use PHPUnit or Atoum.

This module is only for developers who still have some simpletests tests, and
still run PHP 5.6 or lower.

See doc-en.md or doc-fr.md for documentation.
